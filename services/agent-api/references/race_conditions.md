description: Race condition testing for TOCTOU bugs, double-spend, and concurrent state manipulation — invariant divergence between check and commit across multiple actors, transports, or a request racing a background/async worker; includes identity/context confusion where per-request identity (current_user/current_tenant/role/session) held in shared mutable state is overwritten by a concurrent request between the auth check and the action (blended identity)

# Race Conditions

Concurrency bugs enable duplicate state changes, quota bypass, financial abuse, and privilege errors. Treat every read–modify–write and multi-step workflow as adversarially concurrent.

## Mental Model — Invariants Under Concurrent State Transitions

A race condition is a **violation of an invariant the code assumes stays true between a check and a commit**. "Can I send two requests fast?" is only the crudest probe. The discovery question that generalizes to almost any target is:

> **What fact does the system assume remains true between the check and the commit — and who or what can make that fact diverge inside that window?**

So the analysis is two steps: (1) name the **invariant** the code relies on (balance ≥ amount, token unused, row absent, quota not exceeded, status == PENDING, caller still authorized); (2) enumerate the **divergence sources** that can break it before the commit. There are three, and each is a distinct place to look in source:

- **Two actors (same or different principals)** — two concurrent callers of the *same* path, or one attacker across multiple accounts/sessions/IPs, interleave their read-modify-write. SAST hook: a check and its dependent write on a path with no atomic statement / row lock / unique constraint / version guard. (See *Atomicity Gaps*, *Database Isolation*.)
- **Two transports (same invariant, different code paths)** — the same state change reachable via REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC, a bulk/batch endpoint, or a different method/content-type, where only *some* paths enforce the guard. SAST hook: the same invariant guarded in one handler but not in a sibling that mutates the same state. (See *Optimistic Concurrency Evasion*, *Special Contexts*, *Evasion Patterns*.)
- **One actor + a background worker** — a request handler races an *asynchronous* mutator that touches the same state: a queue/event consumer, cron/scheduled job, webhook callback, retry/compensation, cache-expiry refresh, or a detached (unawaited) Promise in the same process. The attacker times their request against the job's window. SAST hook: state read/written by a request handler is *also* written by an async job/consumer with no shared lock, no `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, no optimistic version, or the handler responds before its own write settles. (See *Cross-Service Races*, *Missing await / floating promise*.)

If no enforced atomic boundary (DB transaction + row lock, unique index/upsert, atomic counter, fencing-token lock, or version/ETag check applied on **every** path and actor) spans the check→commit window, at least one of the three axes will eventually break the invariant. This lens drives every section below.

## Where to Look

**Read-Modify-Write**
- Sequences without atomicity or proper locking

**Multi-Step Operations**
- Check → reserve → commit with gaps between phases

**Cross-Service Workflows**
- Sagas, async jobs with eventual consistency

**Rate Limits and Quotas**
- Controls implemented at the edge only

## High-Value Targets

- Payments: auth/capture/refund/void; credits/loyalty points; gift cards
- Coupons/discounts: single-use codes, stacking checks, per-user limits
- Quotas/limits: API usage, inventory reservations, seat counts, vote limits
- Auth flows: password reset/OTP consumption, session minting, device trust
- Identity resolution: per-request `current_user`/`current_tenant`/role stored in shared state (globals, singleton fields, pooled-connection session vars) — overwritten under concurrency (identity/context confusion)
- File/object storage: multi-part finalize, version writes, share-link generation
- Background jobs: export/import create/finalize endpoints; job cancellation/approve
- GraphQL mutations and batch operations; WebSocket actions

## Reconnaissance

### Identify Race Windows

- Look for explicit sequences: "check balance then deduct", "verify coupon then apply", "check inventory then purchase"
- Watch for optimistic concurrency markers: ETag/If-Match, version fields, updatedAt checks
- Examine idempotency-key support: scope (path vs principal), TTL, and persistence (cache vs DB)
- Map cross-service steps: when is state written vs published, what retries/compensations exist

### Signals

- Sequential request fails but parallel succeeds
- Duplicate rows, negative counters, over-issuance, or inconsistent aggregates
- Distinct response shapes/timings for simultaneous vs sequential requests
- Audit logs out of order; multiple 2xx for the same intent; missing or duplicate correlation IDs

## Vulnerability Patterns

### Request Synchronization

- HTTP/2 multiplexing for tight concurrency; send many requests on warmed connections
- Last-byte synchronization: hold requests open and release final byte simultaneously
- Connection warming: pre-establish sessions, cookies, and TLS to remove jitter

### Idempotency and Dedup Bypass

- Reuse the same idempotency key across different principals/paths if scope is inadequate
- Hit the endpoint before the idempotency store is written (cache-before-commit windows)
- App-level dedup drops only the response while side effects (emails/credits) still occur

### Atomicity Gaps

- Lost update: read-modify-write increments without atomic DB statements
- Partial two-phase workflows: success committed before validation completes
- Unique checks done outside a unique index/upsert: create duplicates under load

### Cross-Service Races

- Saga/compensation timing gaps: execute compensation without preventing the original success path
- Eventual consistency windows: act in Service B before Service A's write is visible
- Retry storms: duplicate side effects due to at-least-once delivery without idempotent consumers

### Identity / Context Confusion (request-scoped identity in shared state)

**Invariant:** the principal that *passes the authorization check* is the same principal the *privileged action executes as*. This breaks when per-request identity — `current_user`, `current_tenant`, role, or "the current request" — is held in **shared mutable state** (a module/app global, a singleton/bean field, a connection- or session-level DB variable, a `ThreadLocal`/`contextvar` reused across a pool, or an ORM "current context") instead of being threaded through as request-local data. A concurrent request overwrites that state **between the check and the action**, producing a **blended identity**: the permission check still sees Alice (admin) while the data lookup/write now runs as Tenant B.

Bad interleaving:
- Req-1 sets `current_user = Alice`, `current_tenant = A`; passes the admin check.
- Req-2 (concurrent) overwrites `current_tenant = B` before Req-1's action runs.
- Req-1 executes the privileged action as `user = Alice, tenant = B` — an identity that should never exist.

**Impact:** cross-tenant read/write, an admin action against the wrong tenant, an API key minted in the wrong account, password-reset / MFA / verification artifacts routed to the wrong person, blended privileges. Distinct from double-spend — the corrupted invariant is *authorization identity*, not a counter.

**SAST signals:** identity assigned into process- or connection-shared state and then read by *both* the auth check and the action — e.g. `current_user =` / `current_tenant =` on a global or singleton, `request.user` copied onto a shared object, `SET ROLE` / `SET app.current_tenant` / `search_path` on a **pooled** connection without `SET LOCAL` or a checkout reset, or a principal stored in a `ThreadLocal` / `contextvar` read after an `await` or on a reused pool thread. Fix shape: resolve identity once, keep it **request-local / immutable**, and pass it explicitly into the check and the action.

```python
# VULN — per-request identity in app-shared state; a concurrent request overwrites it mid-flight.
ctx = {}                                       # module/app-global (or a singleton field)
def handle(req):
    ctx["user"] = authenticate(req)            # Req-2 can overwrite ctx between here ...
    ctx["tenant"] = req.tenant
    if not ctx["user"].is_admin:
        abort(403)
    return export_users(tenant=ctx["tenant"])  # ... and here → wrong tenant under a race

# SAFE — identity is request-local and passed explicitly; no shared mutable principal.
def handle(req):
    user = authenticate(req)
    tenant = req.tenant
    if not user.is_admin:
        abort(403)
    return export_users(tenant=tenant)         # check and action use the same local values
```

Cross-ref `shared_client_cache_leak.md` (module-global / pooled-connection / lost-context request state) and `idor.md` / `privilege_escalation.md` (the authorization the race defeats).

### Rate Limits and Quotas

- Per-IP or per-connection enforcement: bypass with multiple IPs/sessions
- Counter updates not atomic or sharded inconsistently; send bursts before counters propagate

### Optimistic Concurrency Evasion

- Omit If-Match/ETag where optional; supply stale versions if server ignores them
- Version fields accepted but not validated across all code paths (e.g., GraphQL vs REST)

### Database Isolation

- Exploit READ COMMITTED/REPEATABLE READ anomalies: phantoms, non-serializable sequences
- **Default isolation takes no read locks → the SELECT check is unlocked.** `READ COMMITTED` (the default on Postgres/Oracle/MSSQL; MySQL defaults to `REPEATABLE READ`) locks only on *write* — a `SELECT balance …` used to validate acquires **no** lock, so two concurrent transactions read the same stale value, both pass the app/SQL check, and both `UPDATE` → overdraft / double-spend. The row lock the `UPDATE` takes comes **after** the check, too late.
- **Isolation-level exploitability is engine-specific — don't assume "REPEATABLE READ = safe":** PostgreSQL RR is *snapshot isolation* and blocks this lost-update/write-skew pattern; **MySQL/MariaDB RR does not** and stays exploitable. Only `SERIALIZABLE` is uniformly safe across engines. So the same code is vulnerable or not depending on the DB engine **and** its configured level.
- **Static signal — transaction opened without an explicit isolation level** on a check-then-write path: `db.BeginTx(ctx)` with no `TxOptions{IsoLevel: …}` (Go pgx/`database/sql`), raw `BEGIN`/`START TRANSACTION` with no `ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE`, an ORM `transaction {}`/`@Transactional` with no isolation attribute — the code silently runs at the exploitable default. Flag it, then check whether the read in the critical section uses `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE` or an optimistic `version`/`WHERE balance >= ?` guard; **SAFE** = SERIALIZABLE, or row-lock **every** read in the window, or a single atomic conditional `UPDATE`/version-CAS.
- Upsert races: use unique indexes with proper ON CONFLICT/UPSERT or exploit naive existence checks
- Lock granularity issues: row vs table; application locks held only in-process

### Distributed Locks

- Redis locks without NX/EX or fencing tokens allow multiple winners
- Locks stored in memory on a single node; bypass by hitting other nodes/regions

## Evasion Patterns

- Distribute across IPs, sessions, and user accounts to evade per-entity throttles
- Switch methods/content-types/endpoints that trigger the same state change via different code paths
- Intentionally trigger timeouts to provoke retries that cause duplicate side effects
- Degrade the target (large payloads, slow endpoints) to widen race windows

## Special Contexts

### GraphQL

- Parallel mutations and batched operations may bypass per-mutation guards
- Ensure resolver-level idempotency and atomicity
- Persisted queries and aliases can hide multiple state changes in one request

### WebSocket

- Per-message authorization and idempotency must hold
- Concurrent emits can create duplicates if only the handshake is checked

### Files and Storage

- Parallel finalize/complete on multi-part uploads can create duplicate or corrupted objects
- Re-use pre-signed URLs concurrently

### Auth Flows

- Concurrent consumption of one-time tokens (reset codes, magic links) to mint multiple sessions
- Verify consume is atomic

### Missing await / floating promise (JS/TS async)

An async call whose Promise is neither `await`ed nor `return`ed runs detached: the surrounding function continues (and may respond to the client) before the operation completes or its error surfaces. On critical operations this silently breaks atomicity, ordering, and error handling — and can let a request proceed before its guard has actually resolved.

**Recon — unawaited critical calls** (no leading `await`/`return`):
- **Locks / mutexes / transactions** — `withMutex(() => ...)`, `withLock(key, fn)`, `withDistributedLock(...)`, `withTransaction(async tx => ...)`. Without `await`, the "protected" section is not actually serialized → the lock/transaction provides no guarantee (TOCTOU, lost updates).
- **DB / cache writes** — `prisma.session.delete(...)`, `db.users.update(...)`, `redis.set(...)` fired without `await` before a response: the response may be sent (or the next step run) before the write lands.
- **Async authorization / validation** — an `isAuthorized(...)` / `checkQuota(...)` Promise not awaited; the guarded action runs regardless of the (later) result → auth/quota bypass.

**Confirm**: the unawaited call returns a Promise (async function or thenable client), AND a subsequent statement (response send, dependent write, security decision) depends on its completion or result. Lost errors from a detached rejection also become unhandled.

**Safe / FP**: fire-and-forget by design (telemetry, best-effort logging) where ordering and failure are irrelevant; calls explicitly handled via `.then()/.catch()` or `void`-marked with justification; synchronous (non-Promise) returns.

## Chaining Attacks

- Race + Business logic: violate invariants (double-refund, limit slicing)
- Race + IDOR: modify or read others' resources before ownership checks complete
- Race + Identity confusion: overwrite shared `current_user`/`current_tenant` mid-request so the auth check passes as one principal while the action runs as another (blended identity → cross-tenant/privileged action)
- Race + CSRF: trigger parallel actions from a victim to amplify effects
- Race + Caching: stale caches re-serve privileged states after concurrent changes

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Model invariants** - Conservation of value, uniqueness, maximums for each workflow
2. **Identify reads/writes** - Where they occur (service, DB, cache)
3. **Baseline** - Single requests to establish expected behavior
4. **Concurrent requests** - Issue parallel requests with identical inputs; observe deltas
5. **Scale and synchronize** - Ramp up parallelism, use HTTP/2, align timing (last-byte sync)
6. **Cross-channel** - Test across web, API, GraphQL, WebSocket
7. **Confirm durability** - Verify state changes persist and are reproducible

## Confirming a Finding

1. Single request denied; N concurrent requests succeed where only 1 should
2. Durable state change proven (ledger entries, inventory counts, role/flag changes)
3. Reproducible under controlled synchronization (HTTP/2, last-byte sync) across multiple runs
4. Evidence across channels (e.g., REST and GraphQL) if applicable
5. Include before/after state and exact request set used

### Dynamic Test / PoC

Baseline: one request should succeed (or fail as expected). Then fire **N identical state-changing requests in parallel** (start N=10–20).

```bash
# Parallel POST — coupon redeem, transfer, vote, OTP consume, etc.
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  curl -s -X POST https://app.example/api/redeem \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"coupon":"DISCOUNT50"}' &
done
wait
```

**Vulnerable signals**: multiple `2xx` for a single-use action; balance/credit changes exceeding one deduction; duplicate rows or audit entries; mixed success/failure where sequential retries always fail.

**Tighter timing** — warm TLS/session first, then release all requests together (background `&` as above, or HTTP/2 multiplexing on one connection) to shrink the check→use window.

**Rate-limit / quota races** — same burst against login, OTP verify, or one-time-claim endpoints; count successes above the documented per-window cap.

Compare durable state (DB, ledger, inventory) before and after — not response bodies alone.

## Common False Alarms

- Truly idempotent operations with enforced ETag/version checks or unique constraints
- Serializable transactions or correct advisory locks/queues
- Visual-only glitches without durable state change
- Rate limits that reject excess with atomic counters

## Business Risk

- Financial loss (double spend, over-issuance of credits/refunds)
- Policy/limit bypass (quotas, single-use tokens, seat counts)
- Data integrity corruption and audit trail inconsistencies
- Privilege or role errors due to concurrent updates

## Analyst Notes

1. Favor HTTP/2 with warmed connections; add last-byte sync for precision
2. Start small (N=5–20), then scale; too much noise can mask the window
3. Target read–modify–write code paths and endpoints with idempotency keys
4. Compare REST vs GraphQL vs WebSocket; protections often differ
5. Look for cross-service gaps (queues, jobs, webhooks) and retry semantics
6. Check unique constraints and upsert usage; avoid relying on pre-insert checks
7. Use correlation IDs and logs to prove concurrent interleaving
8. Widen windows by adding server load or slow backend dependencies
9. Validate on production-like latency; some races only appear under real load
10. Document minimal, repeatable request sets that demonstrate durable impact

## Core Principle

Concurrency safety is a property of every path that mutates state. If any path lacks atomicity, proper isolation, or idempotency, parallel requests will eventually break invariants.

## Java Source Detection Rules

### TRUE POSITIVE: Spring controller singleton with mutable instance field (CWE-362)
- Spring `@Controller`, `@RestController`, and `@Service` beans are **singleton-scoped by default**. Any mutable instance field written per-request is shared across all concurrent requests.
- Pattern: a field declared at class level (e.g., `User user = new User();`) is written inside a request handler method (`user.setId(...)`, `user.setName(...)`) — CONFIRM as CWE-362.
- The fix is always to use a local variable inside the method, not a class-level field.
- Concurrent requests will interleave writes to the shared field, corrupting data.

### FALSE POSITIVE
- `static final` constants — immutable, not a race condition.
- Fields annotated with `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or Spring-managed dependencies — injected once and safe only for stateless singletons; mutable per-request state on singleton beans is a real concurrency hazard and must not be blanket-dismissed.
- Fields only read, never written per-request.

## Python/JS/PHP Source Detection Rules

### Python (Flask / Django)
- **VULN**: check-then-act without database-level lock:
  ```python
  balance = db.query(User).get(user_id).balance
  if balance >= amount:
      # race window here
      db.execute("UPDATE users SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?", (amount, user_id))
  ```
- **VULN**: Financial operations without `SELECT FOR UPDATE`
- **VULN**: File operations: `if not os.path.exists(path): open(path, 'w').write(...)`
- **SAFE**: Django `F()` expressions, `select_for_update()`, `@transaction.atomic`

### JavaScript (Node.js)
- **VULN**: async check-then-act without DB-level lock:
  ```js
  const user = await User.findById(id);
  if (user.credits > 0) {
    await User.updateOne({_id: id}, {$inc: {credits: -1}});
  }
  ```
- **SAFE**: MongoDB atomic operators: `User.findOneAndUpdate({_id: id, credits: {$gt: 0}}, {$inc: {credits: -1}})`

### PHP
- **VULN**: `if ($balance >= $amount) { /* no lock */ $balance -= $amount; }`
- **SAFE**: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside a transaction before modifying balance
- In `JavaSecLab` payment demos, replay/double-submit and delayed balance updates under `logic/pay` should preserve benchmark tag `concurrency` when concurrent interleaving is the intended flaw.
- FALSE POSITIVE guard: do not emit `race_conditions` as a separate tag when the benchmark taxonomy already collapses the same evidence into `concurrency`.

## Sources, Sinks & Sanitizers

Static analysis for race/TOCTOU detects **check-then-use gaps** and **auth-before-bind** patterns in source — complementary to runtime parallel-request testing above.

Commonly affected languages: Java, JavaScript, C/C++, GitHub Actions workflows. Generic Spring `@Controller` singleton mutable fields (CWE-362 heuristic in this reference) and web/API double-spend rely on manual recon and the patterns above.

### CWE-367 — TOCTOU (`TOCTOURace`, `FileSystemRace`, `TOCTOUFilesystemRace`)

**Java sources:** not taint-based — structural match on control flow.

**Java pattern:**
1. `if (obj.syncMethod1())` — condition contains synchronized call on receiver `r`
2. Later `obj.syncMethod2()` on same `r`, controlled by the `if` branch
3. Calls **not** inside a common `synchronized(r)` block
4. Enclosing callable is `PossiblyConcurrentCallable` (has `synchronized` blocks, `volatile` fields, or `ThreadLocal`)

**JavaScript sources:** `fs.exists`/`existsSync`/`stat`/`statSync`/`access`/`accessSync` on path argument.

**JavaScript sinks:** `readFile`/`writeFile`/`appendFile`/`open` (same path or aliased via `AccessPath`).

**JavaScript exclusions (sanitizer-like):**
- `exists` then `readFile` on same path — allowed (read-after-exists is fine)
- Path flows through `open`/`openSync` file handle before use

**C/C++ pattern:** `access`/`_access` check then `open`/`remove`/`chmod`/`rename` on same filename expression; uses guard/control-flow dominance.

**Actions TOCTOU:** `MutableRefCheckoutStep` in privileged workflow protected by `untrusted-checkout` check but not `untrusted-checkout-toctou` — ref mutable after check.

### CWE-421 — Socket auth race (`SocketAuthRace`)

**Sources:** authentication method call (`AuthMethod` from `SensitiveActions`) in condition guarding connection.

**Sinks:** `ServerSocket.accept()` or `ServerServerChannel.accept()` — listening sockets only (client `Socket.connect` excluded as requiring MITM).

**Interpretation:** Auth on channel A, then accept on channel B — attacker may bind the port first.

### CWE-362 — Double-fetch (kernel-only)

**Sink:** second `copy_from_user(dest, userPtr, ...)` where `userPtr` equals first fetch.

**Pattern:** second fetch reachable via `if` false-successor chain from first; no pointer arithmetic on user pointer between fetches.

**Scope:** Linux kernel C/C++ only; not applicable to mobile/web app code.

### CWE-609 — Double-checked locking init race

**Pattern:** DCL on field `f`, assignment visible before post-sync side effects (`SideEffect` — method calls or field writes after assign).

### Good / bad examples

**BAD (JS — file system race):**
```javascript
if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
  fs.writeFileSync(path, data);  // TOCTOU: attacker swaps path between check and write
}
```

**SAFE (JS):** open with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` or write through fd from single `openSync` without prior exists check.

**BAD (Java — TOCTOU race):**
```java
if (collection.contains(key)) {   // synchronized contains
  collection.remove(key);         // synchronized remove — not atomic together
}
```

**SAFE (Java):** single `synchronized(collection) { if (contains) remove; }` block.

**BAD (Java — socket auth race):**
```java
if (authenticate(user)) {
  Socket s = serverSocket.accept();  // auth was on different channel
}
```

### Common False Alarms

- **TOCTOU race (Java):** ignores locals that never escape; ignores fields with consistent external locking (`alwaysLocked`); excludes `Throwable` synchronized methods; loop conditions excluded.
- **TOCTOU race (Java):** two synchronized calls on same object inside one `synchronized(obj)` block — not flagged.
- **File system race (JS):** intentional read-after-exists for read-only paths — suppressed.
- **File system race (JS):** uses `mayHaveStringValue` for path equality — dynamic paths with same runtime value but different AST nodes may be missed or over-approximated.
- **Socket auth race (Java):** heuristic — auth guard must match `AuthMethod` model; custom auth not recognized.
- **Double-fetch (kernel):** high false-positive rate on legitimate re-reads; not in standard Java/Go/JS suites.
- **Double-checked locking init race:** tagged `quality`/`reliability`, not always security-relevant.
- **Actions TOCTOU:** only applies to GitHub Actions workflows, not application code.
